True JIT for endpoints — time-limited, approval-based, auto-terminates at expiry, any elevated application self-terminates when window expires. Application elevation — specific applications elevated without full admin rights. User justification workflows. VirusTotal reputation checking for unknown applications. ServiceNow integration. SIEM integration via syslog. Consumes MFA via SSO/SAML integration — no native MFA. No session recording by design — endpoint scale makes recording impractical, event logging and SIEM integration used instead. Discovery limited to local endpoint accounts only.",

Cedar policy language for fine-grained access control. Automated JIT via Access Workflows — time-limited, approval-based. PagerDuty on-call integration drives JIT group membership automatically. Session recording — SSH and RDP replays, Kubernetes exec command logging. Tamper-hardened audit log in separate AWS account. SSO/MFA via integrations — Duo, Okta, Entra ID, JumpCloud, Keycloak, Ping Identity. SCIM provisioning for user lifecycle. ServiceNow, Jira, Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty integrations.
